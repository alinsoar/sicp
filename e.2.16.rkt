;;; Interval arithmetics does not have inverse.

;;; We are asked either to rewrite the function such that the range of
;;; the rewritten function be the same as the interval obtained by
;;; applying the rewritten function's formula, wih names replaced by
;;; intervals equal to the domain of the corresponding name from the
;;; rewritten function, or to show that this is not possible for each
;;; possible function.

;;; This problem is called "dependency problem", and it is a large
;;; problem, whose understanding is out of the purpose of SICP.
